# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to evaluate how *Plays* campaigns fared versus their **launch dates** and their **funding goals** to determine next steps for *Fever*, a campaing that has nearly reached it's funding goal in a short amount of time

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
A Pivot table and chart were generated to visualize theater overall outcome to their launch date.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals 
Count data was gathered using COUNTIFS across plays, outcome and goal criteria; the outcome percentage was visualized using a line graph

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered 
I overlooked incorporating *plays* into **outcome based on goals** initially but double checked criteria for deliverables and corrected error. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?  
  - More successful outcomes occurred when campaigns in May, June or July however, some years you may experience anomalies. 
  - Also, projects can fail or be canceled any time of the year; those values are pretty consistent throughout the year.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? 
  - Goals less than $19999 are more like to succeed, although goals between $35000 and $44999 have a 60-70% chance of succeeding.

- What are some limitations of this dataset? 
  - Limited year range; potential error in input

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? 
  - Box and whisker to see/confirm presence of outliers
  - pivot tables/graphs that account for country 
  - analysis of outcome based on precent funded
